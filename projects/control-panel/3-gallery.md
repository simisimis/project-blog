The final control box mounted next to the bunk bed. Hinges are at the bottom back, so whe lid will be hanging when pulled down by gravity when opened.

### âœ… Finished Control Box

![Final product side view](./assets/control-box-final-side.jpg)
Side view of the case. USB-C charging port. Hinge design flaws. Wall had to be shaved to allow hinges to open. Front needed supports in the middle when printing as the walls slightly arched in the middle.
