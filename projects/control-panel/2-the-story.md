## Inspiration

Not much of a story here. I visited a friend and saw that he had built a control box for his kidâ€”just a few buttons to turn an IKEA LED strip on and off. As the saying goes: *good artists copy, great artists steal (and call themselves artists).*

## Motivation

I decided to pick on a challenge. Like some of my previous projects, this one touches on several of my hobbies: electronics, CAD modeling, and 3D printing. Seemed like the perfect excuse to dive in.

## Sketching It Out

After thinking it through, hereâ€™s what I came up with:

- An RGB LED strip going around the bedâ€”white LEDs felt too boring.
- A cheap OEM 12V 5A power supply and a Gledopto ESP32-based LED controller with a built-in mic.
- A control box mounted next to the bunk bed. Since there wasn't much space to secure it, I decided to hang it.
- An ESP32 DevKit MCU running ESPHome firmware.
- A rechargeable 18650 batteryâ€”because it's for a 4yo (ab)user, and Iâ€™m not swapping AAs every day.
- A USB-C port for charging and power.

## Shopping List

### Tools

- Many. All kinds of ðŸŒš

### Bed LEDs

- 3 meters of SK6812 RGBW 60LED/m (widely available on Amazon/Aliexpress)
- Any 12V 3A+ DC power supply
- [Gledopto GL-C-010WL](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006157192935.html)

### Control Box Internals

- Arcade buttons (lots of options online and locally)
- ESP32 MCU (ESPHome supports a wide rangeâ€”from ESP8266 to newer ones)
- 18650 lithium rechargeable battery
- [USB-C battery charging module](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006114282858.html)

### Control Box Case (Optional)

- 3D printer
- Filament
- CAD modeling skills
- Heat inserts, standoffs, M3 screws

A custom case is nice, but you could also reuse a tin cookie box, a cardboard box (for prototyping), or put together something from wood..

## The Process / Pr(ðŸ‘¹)ss

After ordering a bunch of arcade buttons, I let my son pick the ones he wanted. I laid them out on a cardboard box to visualize the layout and spot early design issues before diving into CAD.

### My CAD Workflow

1. Sketch the shape in Plasticity.
2. Transfer to Blender using the Blender Bridge add-on.
3. Clean up the messy mesh and export as `.stl`.
4. Slice and send to the 3D printer.

### Design Considerations

One key requirement: hinges. Since the box is hanging and will eventually need maintenance (button/MCU replacements), I wanted a hinged lid that opens without pulling on wires and hangs instead of having to put it away somewhere.

I used brass heat inserts to allow for repeated assembly/disassembly with proper screw tension.

The case had to be split into parts due to 3D printer bed size limitations. I used a dovetail joint and internal screws to hold it together.

Once printed and assembled, I mounted the battery, charger module, MCU, and buttons, and wired it all up.

### The Fun Bugs

Naturally, a few issues popped upâ€”mainly hinge design flaws. Some broke easily, others didnâ€™t open smoothly. Hopefully, inspiration will strike before the next build.

### Wiring a Push-to-Light Button

I wanted the button's built-in LED to light up **only while the button is pressed**. A small challenge, but a fun one.

Thankfully, I had a transistor kit that had PNP transistor(BC557). Here's how I wired it:

1. Button LED positive â†’ 5V  
2. Button LED negative â†’ transistor **collector**  
3. Transistor **emitter** â†’ GND  
4. Transistor **base** â†’ 1kÎ© resistor â†’  
   - MCU pin (pulled HIGH by default)  
   - Push button pin #1  
5. Push button pin #2 â†’ GND  

**How it works:**  
When the button is pressed, the MCU pin is pulled LOW, allowing current from the collector to the emitter and lighting the LED. When released, the MCU pin goes HIGH and cuts off the ground path, turning the LED off.

### Final Wiring

- All buttons: pin #1 â†’ GND  
- All buttons: pin #2 â†’ dedicated MCU pins  

Since ESPHome uses YAML config, I declared pins directly in the config file using their docs as reference.

### Wi-Fi Delay UX Fix

When the box powers on, it takes a few seconds to connect to Wi-Fiâ€”which is *way* too long for a kid's attention span.  
To handle this, I added another LED next to the power switch, wired it to the MCU, and programmed it to light up **only after Wi-Fi connects**. My son now knows to press buttons *only* when that LED is on.

And thatâ€™s it. A fun weekend project that mixes electronics, CAD, 3D printingâ€”and gave me a good excuse to catch up on some podcasts.
