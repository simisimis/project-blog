### Beautiful projects to learn from
https://github.com/AlaaSaadAbdo/battoota - for it's collection of models
https://github.com/ianmaclarty/ik  - for it's low profile
https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/KLOTZ - a-z product delivery
https://github.com/Bastardkb/Dilemma - LEDs, encoders, trackpad. Beautiful assembly guide
https://github.com/beekeeb - a bakery of opensource keyboards.
