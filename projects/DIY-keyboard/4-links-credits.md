### What gave me hope

Before that I thought the only way to get anything from this project is to use QMK/ZMK and obey they're requirements. 

https://github.com/simmsb/keyboard - for his profile status - _I *will* put rust on your microcontroller, and you *will* enjoy it._
https://www.youtube.com/@therustybits - where I got confidence I can program 1key keyboard.
https://www.youtube.com/@rhymu - for 80h+ of streams where he's walking a similar path.
### Where I started sketching (declaratively)  my layout

https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-part1-units-points/ - one stop shop to learn about the unofficial ergogen tool:
https://ergogen.cache.works/

I haven't used resources bellow. But good to know there are alternatives.

### Beautiful projects to get inspired from

https://github.com/AlaaSaadAbdo/battoota - for it's collection of models
https://github.com/ianmaclarty/ik  - for it's low profile
https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/KLOTZ - a-z product delivery
https://github.com/Bastardkb/Dilemma - LEDs, encoders, trackpad. Beautiful assembly guide
https://github.com/beekeeb - a bakery of opensource keyboards.

 https://fingerpunch.xyz/product/faux-fox-keyboard/  - not much to learn from this closed source other than where to buy it, however I was shocked to see how close it got to what I've been sketching for myself for a couple of weeks now.

### Not everything has to be created by me
