## Inspiration

At the moment my services for my hosts are declared in my nix monorepo. I wanted to better separate the responsibilities. Use more tools that make sense rather than just solve all my problems with a hammer. 

## Motivation

To be consistent with the way I deliver production environments I tasked myself to treat myself as I treat others.
